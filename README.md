This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Intro
![Robosaver](robosaver_screenshot.jpeg)

Robosaver is a DeFi app on Ethereum that aggregates rates from different Decentralized Financial protocols such as Compound, and auto-rebalances user accounts to provide them highest earning interest rate. The app finds the highest interest rate and easily swaps the user's Bitcoin into tBTC and then into the currency that is yielding the most returns while depositing the funds for them in Compound. Robosaver won 2nd place in the Compound Finance & Keep bounty at ETHDenver 2020.
